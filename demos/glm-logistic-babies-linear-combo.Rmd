```{r, message = FALSE}
#library(LogisticDx) # This has the data set on low birth weights in infants
```

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(clp)
```

# Reformat Data Set to Match Example 2.4 on Page 38 of CLP

```{r}
data(lbw)

mod <- glm(low ~ weight + age + black + other + smoker, data = lbw.clp, family = binomial)
```

# Determine Confidence Curve for Expected Response at the Following Covariate Valuess

```{r}
# From CLP:
x.black <- c(1, 50, 23.238, 1, 0, 1)

# Not in CLP
x.white <- c(1, 50, 23.238, 0, 0, 1)
```

# Construct Confidence Curves for Expected Response

```{r}
cc.black <- glm.lincom.conf(mod, x.black)
```

```{r}
cc.white <- glm.lincom.conf(mod, x.white)
```

# Compare Blacks and Whites

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
curve(cc.black$cconf(x), from = 0, to = 1, n = 2001, lwd = 2)
curve(cc.white$cconf(x), from = 0, to = 1, n = 2001, add = TRUE, col = 'grey')
abline(h = 0.95, lty = 3)

curve(cc.black$pconf(x), from = 0, to = 1, n = 2001, lwd = 2)
curve(cc.white$pconf(x), from = 0, to = 1, n = 2001, add = TRUE, col = 'grey')
